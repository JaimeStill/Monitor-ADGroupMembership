# Monitor-ADGroupMembership

This is a modified version of [lazywinadmin](https://github.com/lazywinadmin)'s [Monitor-ADGroupMembership](https://github.com/lazywinadmin/Monitor-ADGroupMembership/blob/master/Monitor-ADGroupMemberShip.ps1) script. It uses `Send-MailMessage` as opposed to `SmtpClient` to manage emails.
